Building
=======================
*NIX:
make sure you have compiler installed
Required extra libaries: libopenal-dev libsdl-dev libmad-dev
Run 'make'

WIN:
MSVC solution files are in misc/msvc/ (VC9) and misc/msvc10 (VC10)

If you don't have MSVC, install mingw, start it and change to openmohaa
directory, run 'make'

You will need include files and libraries for OpenAL, SDL and libmad.

MOSX:
Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'
You will need openal, sdl and libmad.

The built binaries reside in the 'build' directory.



For further instructions:
Please refer to ioquake3's README (README.ioq3).
Or get in touch with any of our developers (->forums/irc).

Running
=======================
In order to run the game, you need the original MOHAA media files,
which are stored in pak*.pk3 files.

Copy all pak*.pk3 files and sound/ directory from your MOHAA/main directory
into openmohaa's 'main' directory (found in the 'build' directory).

Now you need the SDL library. Windows users can download the ready-to-use
DLL file at http://www.libsdl.org/, Linux users need to find the right packages
like libsdl and libopenal libmad

Now run openmohaa.

Note that with non-US keyboard settings, you may have problems toggling
the in-game console. The right key should type '`' or '~'
