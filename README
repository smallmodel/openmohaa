Building
=======================
*NIX:
make sure you have compiler and libopenal-dev and libsdl-dev installed
Run 'make'

WIN:
MSVC solution files are in misc/msvc/ (VC9) and misc/msvc10 (VC10)

If you don't have MSVC, install mingw, start it and change to openmohaa
directory, run 'make'

MOSX:
Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'

The built binaries reside in the 'build' directory.
*** shell script is outdated ***



For further instructions:
Please refer to ioquake3's README (README.ioq3).
Or get in touch with any of our developers (->forums/irc).

Running
=======================
In order to run the game, you need the original MOHAA media files,
which are stored in pak*.pk3 files.

Copy all pak*.pk3 from your MOHAA/main directory into openmohaa's
'main' directory (found in the 'build' directory).

Now you need the SDL library. Windows users can download the ready-to-use
DLL file at http://www.libsdl.org/, Linux users need to find the right packages
like libsdl and libopenal etc

Now run openmohaa with start parameters:
+set bot_enable 0

Note that with non-US keyboard settings, you may have problems toggling
the in-game console. The right key should type '`' or '~'

The best way for testing is starting a dedicated server with the
original MOHAA binaries and joining the game with the openmohaa client.
The network code has been adopted from MOHAA to ensure compatibility,
but it only works for the client until now.
The openmohaa server netcode is not yet finished, but even if it works
the original MOHAA server will be the better choice until fgame code is done.

Developing
=======================
There is plenty of work to do. Basically, our goal is to get openmohaa
compatible to MOHAA. If you want to help out, just follow the above
instructions to get your development system set up.
It doesn't help anybody if you tell us you'd like to help out but never
submit one single line of code.
So *before* you ask to get on the team, do something. Feel free to ask
for help. Just ask for advise on what to do to help out.
When you've produced some code, tell us and we will consider access to
the subversion system for you.

After all, you are always welcome in our irc channel and forums!
