This file really needs some work. Sorry, guys. If anyone can write a better README, please do and send it to us. :)

Building
=======================
Please refer to ioquake3's README (README.ioq3).

Running
=======================
You need the VMs/shared libraries of the modules from the main subdirectory inside the build directory. DO NOT USE 
MISSIONPACK ONES, they will fail.
Now this can be a little tricky. At the current, early development state, OpenMoHAA requires both Quake III (or compatible) and MoHAA's pk3 files. If you don't have a copy of Q3 Arena, get OpenArena (http://www.openarena.ws/), which is a free clone of Q3. When you've already got the Q3 (or OA) pk3 files at hand, you will notice there's a name conflict between them and MoHAA's pk3s. I recommend you to copy MoHAA's pk3s into OMoHAA's main directory and rename them to mohaapak0.pk3, mohaapak2.pk3 and so on. Remember, you need both games' pk3s or you will experience all kinds of failures!
When you're done with the pk3s and binaries, run the game, open up the console and type for example map dm/mohdm1 and run around it. 
There's not much more you can do there yet. Enjoy!
