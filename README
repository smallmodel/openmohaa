Building
=======================
*NIX:
Run 'make'

WIN:
Download and install Mingw and Msys from http://www.mingw.org/
Open Msys console, change to openmohaa directory, run 'make'

There is an MSVS project file included, but it does not compile.
I advise you to just install mingw/msys to compile the code, you
can still use the VS IDE to write your code. REALLY!! VS may be
great, but so is GCC!

MOSX:
Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'

The built binaries reside in the 'build' directory.

For further instructions:
Please refer to ioquake3's README (README.ioq3).
Or get in touch with any of our developers (->forums/irc).

Running
=======================
In order to run the game, you need the original MOHAA media files,
which are stored in pak*.pk3 files.

Copy all pak*.pk3 from your MOHAA/main directory into openmohaa's
'main' directory (found in the 'build' directory).

At this stage of development, openmohaa still needs some files
which cannot be read from the MOHAA pk3's so you must get a
Quake 3 Arena pak0.pk3 from somewhere (Q3demo or OpenArena will do fine).
Take that pak0.pk3, rename it to qPak0.pk3 (to resolve the name conflict)
and copy it to openmohaa's 'main' directory.

Now you need the SDL library. Windows users can download the ready-to-use
DLL file at http://www.libsdl.org/

Now run openmohaa with start parameters:
+set sv_pure 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_game 0 +set vm_ui 0 +developer 1

The best way for testing is starting a dedicated server with the
original MOHAA binaries and joining the game with the openmohaa client.
The network code has been adopted from MOHAA to ensure compatibility,
but it only works for the client until now.
The openmohaa server netcode is not yet finished, but even if it works
the original MOHAA server will be the better choice until fgame code is done.

Developing
=======================
There is plenty of work to do. Basically, our goal is to get openmohaa
compatible to MOHAA. If you want to help out, just follow the above
instructions to get your development system set up.
It doesn't help anybody if you tell us you'd like to help out but never
submit one single line of code.
So *before* you ask to get on the team, do something. Feel free to ask
for help. Just ask for advise on what to do to help out.
When you've produced some code, tell us and we will consider access to
the subversion system for you.

After all, you are always welcome in our irc channel and forums!
