Building
=======================
*NIX:
make sure you have compiler and libopenal-dev and libsdl-dev installed
Run 'make'

WIN:
MSVC solution files are in misc/msvc/ (VC9) and misc/msvc10 (VC10)

If you don't have MSVC, install mingw, start it and change to openmohaa
directory, run 'make'

MOSX:
Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'

The built binaries reside in the 'build' directory.
*** shell script is outdated ***



For further instructions:
Please refer to ioquake3's README (README.ioq3).
Or get in touch with any of our developers (->forums/irc).

Running
=======================
In order to run the game, you need the original MOHAA media files,
which are stored in pak*.pk3 files.

Copy all pak*.pk3 from your MOHAA/main directory into openmohaa's
'main' directory (found in the 'build' directory).

Now you need the SDL library. Windows users can download the ready-to-use
DLL file at http://www.libsdl.org/, Linux users need to find the right packages
like libsdl and libopenal etc

Now run openmohaa with start parameters:
+set bot_enable 0

Note that with non-US keyboard settings, you may have problems toggling
the in-game console. The right key should type '`' or '~'



Developing
=======================
There is plenty of work to do. Basically, our goal is to get openmohaa
compatible to MOHAA. If you want to help out, just follow the above
instructions to get your development system set up.
If you experience problems getting started try get in touch with me (wombat)

After all, you are always welcome in our irc channel and forums!
