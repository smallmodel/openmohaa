/*
It should be noted that the normal file structure for
a tiki file is that the .TIK file resides in a directory
above the directory that contains the data. For example,
MoHAA's mp40.tik file reside in:

/models/weapons/

Whereas its actual data files (single skd file and several skc's) reside in:

/models/weapons/mp40/
